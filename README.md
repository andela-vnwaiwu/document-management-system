## Document Management Systems
This a Javascript implemented document management api with access levels, roles and priviledges.
Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it. Also, each document specifies the date it was published.
Users are categorized by roles.

#### Postman Collection
Run the App on `POSTMAN`.

#### *Features*

1. **Authentication**
- It uses JWT for authentication.  
- It generates a token and returns to the client.  
- It verifies the token on every request to authenticated endpoints.

2. **Users**
- It allows users to be created.  
- It sets a newly created user's role to `regular` by default.   
- It allows only the created user and the admin to edit, and update its information.   
- All registered users can be retrieved by the admin user.

3. **Roles**
- It ensures that users have a role.   
- It ensures users roles could be `admin` or `regular`.   
- It ensures new roles can be created, updated and deleted by an admin user.   
- It returns all roles to an admin user.

4. **Documents**
- It allows new documents to be created/saved by users.  
- It ensures all documents have an access defined (default access is `public`).  
- It allows only admin users to retrieve all documents regardless of the document access.  
- It ensures ONLY the user's private and others publicly accessed documents to be retrieved by the user.     
- It ensures only authenticated users can delete, edit and update documents they own.   
- It allows admin to delete any document regardless of the document access level.
